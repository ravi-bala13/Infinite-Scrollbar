You are required to make a list that will scroll infinitely

add 25 items on load

user overflow css property to manage the scrollbar for the div

add event listener to list element ( can use debouncing / throttling here )

use scroll event

check a condition to see if you have reached the end of the element

look at the following properties in the Element API

scrollTop

clientHeight

scrollHeight

getBoundingClientRect

getClientRects

use in any combination to achieve your task

when the condition is met, load 25 more items into the list

For the ones who are got it already done in plain JS
